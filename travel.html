                <p>Why are there here more dogs than kids? Why not all that looks a baguette is a baguette? Where are Parisian taxis? Who counts the trees in the city? These are the questions to some of the most interesting curiosities of the French capital city. I do not know about you, but I love the place. </p>

                <p>Meiringen Meringues define sweet as a notion. But they are not the only sweet thing about this place in Jungfrau region of the Alps. Go find out why Sherlock Holmes couldn't have possibly survived the fall down the waterfall or enjoy the Via Alpina trail. Worth visiting. </p>

Along a mediterranean promenade you can enjoy the views on the Alps mirrored in the blue waters of the lake.</p>

                <h2>Year-round marvel</h2>
                <p>Why is Grindelwald called a 'glacier village'? Is it true that the total length of ski pistes is equal to the size of Switzerland from north to south? Grindelwald stole my heart the first time I looked out of the wooden window frame of a wooded mountain hut and saw the village full of light in the middle of a snow clad vallay. A treasure.</p>

                    Is there a kind of rice in the world that you cannot find on Bali? Is there as many shrines on the island as there are households? Why is Bali called the island of the happy people?
                    Bali teaches you the trust in fate as soon as you join the traffic. But you are already in paradise, aren't you?</p>

                    New York is as unique as the people who live there. They say you take photos of the locals on your first day there. On your second day, you just laugh. On the third you kind of look similar. On the fourth, people start to take pictures of you. </p>
